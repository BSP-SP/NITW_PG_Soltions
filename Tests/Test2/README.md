## MCQS
#### 1.The Central Limit Theorem states that the distribution of the sample means will be approximately normal if -
- All possible samples are selected
- **The sample size is large**
- The standard error of the sampling distribution is small
- Bias of estimation of population mean is small

#### 2.Which of the following scenarios results in a Type I error in a Null Hypothesis Testing?
- Null hypothesis is not rejected but should be rejected
- **Null hypothesis is rejected but should not be rejected**
- A test statistic is incorrect
- All three of the above

#### 3.Based on the data set and its specifications as described below, calculate the coefficient and intercept of the Regression Line obtained as a result of Linear Regression: 

Specifications of data:
n = 5
Sum(x)= 10
Sum(y)= 20
Sum(xy) = 49 and 
Sum(x * x) = 30
- Coefficient = 10 & Intercept = 0.9
- **Coefficient = 0.9 & Intercept = 2.2**
- Coefficient = -2.2 & Intercept = 0.9
- Coefficient = -0.9 & Intercept = 10

#### 4.Samples of size 25 are selected from a population with mean 40 and standard deviation 7.5. Answer the following question based on this information: The standard error of the sampling distribution of means is -
- 0.3
- **1.5**
- 7.5
- 1.3

#### 5.The entire group of data under consideration for applying statistical learning and a subgroup of that data are termed as-
- Data & Sample
- **Population & Sample**
- Sample & Population
- Population and Category
